# UKF_EKF_Comparison_Radar_Data_Simulation
A simple implementation to find out the performance difference between UKF and EKF

compareEKFUKFsingle: Run the simulation once; Display the trajectories and time-error diagram.

compareEKFUKFbatch: Run Monte Carlo simulations; Display the average time-error diagram
